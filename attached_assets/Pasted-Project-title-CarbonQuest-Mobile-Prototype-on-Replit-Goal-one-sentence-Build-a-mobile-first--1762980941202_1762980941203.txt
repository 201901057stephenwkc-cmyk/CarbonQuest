Project title: CarbonQuest — Mobile (Prototype on Replit)

Goal (one sentence)
Build a mobile-first, gamified sustainability app for Gen Z that turns daily eco-actions into quests, boss battles and social leaderboards so users form habits and see measurable environmental impact. Reference: CarbonQuest prototype doc. 

CarbonQuest - Prototyping & Use…

Target platform & stack (recommended)

Platform: Mobile (iOS & Android) — prototype with React Native + Expo on Replit.

Language: TypeScript.

State: Redux Toolkit or React Context for global state.

Navigation: React Navigation.

Backend (prototype): Firebase Firestore + Firebase Auth (email/Google), Cloud Functions for server logic (boss battle calculations, rewards conversion).

Optional: Supabase if preferred.

Assets & UI: Pull screens from Figma wireframe referenced in the doc; use placeholder images & SVGs for Carbon Ogre and icons.

High-level requirements (features summary)

Onboarding: short, gamified onboarding that explains Carbon Ogre, World Health bar, XP and Levels.

Main dashboard: shows XP (e.g., 40/100), Level, World Health progress, four categories (Transport, Food, Energy, Consumption) each with Level and Streak.

Daily quests: list of actionable quests with progress (e.g., “Ride your bike 3 times” 2/3).

Active quests & habits UI: complete quests, show stars/points rewards (50/75).

Boss battles: progress meter that aggregates user & community quest completions to trigger battles against the Carbon Boss/Ogre.

Leaderboards: global and friends leaderboard; provide context on ranks & rewards.

Rewards & conversion: eco-points exchangeable for real-world rewards (placeholder implementation).

Social features: friend invites, share progress, Discord/Instagram integration for growth.

Analytics & KPIs: retention, average daily quest completion, active community growth.

Accessibility: readable fonts, contrast, tappable areas >= 44px.

Testing: unit tests for key logic, e2e flows for onboarding → quest → boss fight.

UX screens & components (explicit)

Splash / Onboarding

3 screens: mission statement, how quests work, social features.

CTA: sign up / continue as guest.

Authentication

Email/password + Google sign-in (Firebase), skip/guest mode.

Profile creation (username, avatar).

Main Dashboard

Top: User XP (progress bar), Level (e.g., Lv 1).

World Health bar (global progress %).

Four category cards: Transport, Food, Energy, Consumption; each shows Level & streak.

CTA to “Active Quests” and “Battle”.

Daily Habits / Active Quests

Scrollable list of daily quests; each card shows current progress, rewards (stars), and “Mark Complete” or “Log Activity”.

Subtasks (e.g., 0/5 plant-based meals).

Buttons: “Claim”, “Fail”, “Share”.

Quest Detail

Title, description, required actions, expiry, rewards, suggested tips.

Evidence upload optional (photo or quick check-in).

Boss Battle Screen

World Health progress and current Boss HP.

Visual of Carbon Ogre; show community contribution & how individual quests feed boss damage.

Triggered when collective progress threshold reached — mini animation & reward distribution.

Leaderboards

Tabs: Friends, Campus, Global.

Show rank, XP, recent achievements, context on rewards for positions.

Rewards / Store

List of redeemable items (placeholder coupons, donation options, partner discounts).

Display conversion rules for eco-points → real impact.

Profile & Social

Track Stats: quests completed, streaks, emissions avoided (estimates).

Invite friends, share to Instagram, join Discord.

Settings & Help

Accessibility, notifications, data & privacy, FAQ.

Data model (example Firestore collections)

users: { uid, displayName, avatar, xp, level, streaks: {transport, food, energy, consumption}, joinedAt, friends: [uid], campusTag }

quests: { id, title, category, description, target, unit, rewardStars, repeatsDaily, activeFrom, activeTo }

userQuestProgress: { userId, questId, progress, lastCompletedAt }

boss: { id, name, hp, maxHp, worldHealthPercent, active: bool, triggeredAt, contributors: [{userId, damage}] }

leaderboards: computed or aggregated collection

rewards: { id, title, costStars, type, redemptionInfo }

analytics: events for onboarding_complete, quest_completed, boss_triggered, reward_redeemed

Core gamification rules (implement exactly)

Quest reward: completing a quest grants X stars + XP.

Streaks: completing the same category quest daily increments streak; streaks grant bonus XP at thresholds (3, 7, 14).

Boss battle trigger: global aggregated quest completions fill World Health; when it reaches threshold (e.g., 1000 community stars) Boss appears.

Boss damage: each quest completion converts to damage = floor(stars / 10) or similar balanced formula coded server-side.

Reward conversion transparency: show how points translate to impact (e.g., “50 stars ≈ 0.5 trees planted (est.)”) — estimates can be placeholder values with a disclaimer.

API & backend endpoints (sample)

POST /api/auth/login (Firebase handled)

GET /api/quests/today

POST /api/quest/:id/complete { evidence? }

GET /api/boss/status

POST /api/boss/contribute { userId, damage }

POST /api/rewards/redeem

GET /api/leaderboard?scope=global|friends|campus

Analytics & KPIs (instrumentation)

Track events: user_registered, onboarding_complete, quest_view, quest_complete, boss_defeated, reward_redeemed, invite_sent, share.

Dashboard metrics to show:

Retention rate (target: 60% after 4 weeks).

Average daily quests completed (target: 3 per user / day).

Active community growth (target: 500 active users within 3 months). 

CarbonQuest - Prototyping & Use…

Growth & channels (implement small hooks)

Invite code flow with campus tagging.

Shareable achievement cards (image that can be posted to Instagram).

Discord community link & in-app join button.

Referral rewards (in-app stars for invites).

Design & assets

Use the Figma wireframe / Claude clickable prototype as source of truth for layout and copy (link referenced in the doc).

Provide placeholder Carbon Ogre SVG / animated Lottie.

Color palette: friendly, eco tones; ensure contrast for accessibility.

Testing & validation tasks (deliverables for prototype build)

Implement unit tests for quest completion, streak logic, XP calculations.

Manual e2e test checklist: sign up → complete 3 quests → observe XP/streak updates → trigger boss contribution → see leaderboard updates.

Usability: ensure boss flow is visually and functionally clear (feedback from doc: earlier users found boss flow confusing — fix with clear progress bars and triggers). 

CarbonQuest - Prototyping & Use…

MVP scope (what to build in the initial Replit prototype)

Auth (Firebase)

Main dashboard + 4 category cards

Daily quest list + complete/claim flow

World Health progress & Boss status visualization (no complex multiplayer sync; aggregate mock data acceptable)

Leaderboard (friends via simple follower list)

Basic rewards redemption UI (mocked)

Analytics events logging to console or Firebase Analytics
